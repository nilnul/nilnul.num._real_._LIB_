# nilnul.num._real_._LIB_
This is about real numbers with arbitrary precision; in orther words, strict math of real numbers. But we also provide same processing for "double", the floating number, where necessary.

After definition of real numbers, we defined operators.
And then we defined expressions where var is a special expression, with the help of System.Linq.Expressions. We can then do some symbols computations, or algebra; see num.real.expr_.Algebraic, for a peek.
