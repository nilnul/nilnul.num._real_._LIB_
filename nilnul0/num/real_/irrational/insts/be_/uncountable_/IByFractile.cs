	/// <summary>
	/// To show that the real numbers are uncountable, we typically use Cantor’s diagonalization argument on the decimal expansion of real numbers. However, the argument is	not very clean because the decimal expansion of a real number is not unique.
	/// Example: 0.¯9 = 1
	/// Instead of the decimal expansion, we can use the continued fraction expressions.
	/// Cantor’s diagonalization argument says that the infinite continued fractions are uncountable.Since the set of infinite continued fractions is in bijection with the set of	irrational numbers, this says that the irrational numbers are uncountable.The finite	continued fractions are in 2-1 correspondence with the set of rational numbers and	hence the set of rational numbers is countable.
