	/*In algebra, the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity[1][2] expresses the product of two sums of two squares as a sum of two squares in two different ways. Hence the set of all sums of two squares is closed under multiplication. Specifically, the identity says
( a 2 + b 2 ) ( c 2 + d 2 ) = ( a c − b d ) 2 + ( a d + b c ) 2 ( 1 ) = ( a c + b d ) 2 + ( a d − b c ) 2 . ( 2 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)\left(c^{2}+d^{2}\right)&{}=\left(ac-bd\right)^{2}+\left(ad+bc\right)^{2}&&(1)\\&{}=\left(ac+bd\right)^{2}+\left(ad-bc\right)^{2}.&&(2)\end{aligned}}} 

For example,
( 1 2 + 4 2 ) ( 2 2 + 7 2 ) = 26 2 + 15 2 = 30 2 + 1 2 . {\displaystyle (1^{2}+4^{2})(2^{2}+7^{2})=26^{2}+15^{2}=30^{2}+1^{2}.} 

The identity is also known as the Diophantus identity,[3][4] as it was first proved by Diophantus of Alexandria. It is a special case of Euler's four-square identity, and also of Lagrange's identity.
Brahmagupta proved and used a more general identity (the Brahmagupta identity), equivalent to
( a 2 + n b 2 ) ( c 2 + n d 2 ) = ( a c − n b d ) 2 + n ( a d + b c ) 2 ( 3 ) = ( a c + n b d ) 2 + n ( a d − b c ) 2 . ( 4 ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\left(a^{2}+nb^{2}\right)\left(c^{2}+nd^{2}\right)&{}=\left(ac-nbd\right)^{2}+n\left(ad+bc\right)^{2}&&(3)\\&{}=\left(ac+nbd\right)^{2}+n\left(ad-bc\right)^{2}.&&(4)\end{aligned}}} 

This shows that, for any fixed A, the set of all numbers of the form x2 + A y2 is closed under multiplication.
The identity holds in the ring of integers, the ring of rational numbers and, more generally, any commutative ring. All four forms of the identity can be verified by expanding each side of the equation. Also, (2) can be obtained from (1), or (1) from (2), by changing b to −b, and likewise with (3) and (4).*/
